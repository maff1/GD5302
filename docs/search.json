We started with 1165 schizophrenia cases and 942 ancestry-matched population controls. After QC, 1162 cases and 936 controls remained. Variant annotation focused on empirically determined annotation methods. - What are GWAS? - Key concepts: SNPs, genetic variants, allele frequencies\n\n ref."

    "text": "Methodology\n\nCommon steps in a GWAS study (1-4).\na | Data can be gathered from study cohorts or obtained from biobanks and repositories containing genetic and phenotypic information. It’s imperative to address confounders and avoid recruitment biases like collider bias.\nb | Genotypic data can be acquired through microarrays for common variants or next-generation sequencing methods like whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES).\nc | Quality control involves wet-lab steps such as genotype calling and DNA switches, and dry-lab processes like filtering out poor single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and individuals, detecting population strata, and computing principal components. The figure illustrates clustering based on genetic substrata.\nd | Phasing genotypic data and imputing untyped genotypes rely on reference populations from repositories such as the 1000 Genomes Project or TopMed. The example demonstrates imputation of genotypes like SNP1 and SNP3 based on directly assayed genotypes of other SNPs.\ne | Genetic association tests are conducted for each variant, utilizing appropriate models (e.g., additive, non-additive, linear, or logistic regression). Corrections for confounders and management of multiple testing are essential, with inspection for unusual patterns and generation of summary statistics.\nf | Results from multiple smaller cohorts are merged using standardized statistical pipelines.\ng | Results are replicated either internally or externally in an independent cohort, necessitating ancestral matching and absence of shared individuals or family members between cohorts.\nh | In silico analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involves utilizing external resources for tasks like fine-mapping, SNP to gene mapping, gene to function mapping, pathway analysis, genetic correlation analysis, Mendelian randomization, and polygenic risk prediction. Experimental validation or testing in relevant human models follows GWAS.\n\n\n\n\nStudy design\nData collection\nStatistical analysis\nReplication and validation\n\n\n ref."
