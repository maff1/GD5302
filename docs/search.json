Students will perform Quality Control (QC), conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to account for population structure, association tests for a simulated binary phenotype and build genotypes for a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nA research team investigating genetic data related to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) experienced a hard disk drive failure on their High Performance Computing (HPC) system. Fortunately, they had a backup, which allowed them to retrieve some of the lost data. However, instead of obtaining a single file, they found several versions of the same dataset with similar timestamps. The research team had a previous set of plots for population structure and association analysis from previous analysis than they could use as ground truth. Uncertain about the integrity of each version, they tasked their data scientists with determining whether running a standard Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) pipeline would yield consistent results across the recovered datasets."
